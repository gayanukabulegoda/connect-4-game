The Connect 4 game is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid!

Players choose GREEN and BLUE discs. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs vertically or horizontally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win.

## Overview
Welcome to the Connect Four game repository, where players strategically drop GREEN or BLUE discs into the grid to form vertical or horizontal lines of four. In this classic battle, the game unfolds as opponents vie to outmaneuver each other. 

What sets this implementation apart is the integration of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, bringing advanced artificial intelligence to the computer player. Whether challenging the intelligent computer opponent, every move counts in this quest to be the first to connect four in a row and claim victory. Immerse yourself in the thrill of strategic gameplay and enjoy a timeless duel of wits in Connect Four!
